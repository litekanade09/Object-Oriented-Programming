In this section, I delve into the principles of Object-Oriented Programming in Java, a paradigm that promotes code reusability and modularity.

Core Concepts: Explained the four main principles of OOP: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, with examples to illustrate each concept.

Class and Object Definition: Demonstrated how to define classes and create objects in Java, emphasizing the relationship between the two.

Inheritance in Action: Showcased how inheritance allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

Polymorphism: Illustrated method overloading and overriding, highlighting how polymorphism enhances flexibility in code execution.

Real-World Applications: Provided examples of OOP in practical scenarios, such as designing complex systems like e-commerce platforms or game engines.
